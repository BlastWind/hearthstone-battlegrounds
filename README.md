### Roadmap
##### 1. Establish the battlegrounds infrastructure.
1. Establish turn and gold system.
2. Implement shop phase. Support dummy minion in shop (one dummy minion for each tier). Randomness implemented. Shared pool not implemented.
3. Implement combat phase. Currently, just have an AI with a dummy minion.
4. Write code that supports just a single player.
