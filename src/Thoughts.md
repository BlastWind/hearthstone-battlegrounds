These are random development thoughts/log.

The current repo has too much structure, I think it will be fine to do without the distinction between Terminal/better GUI.

Claude provided a good roadmap of development:
1. Work out core functionalities and have a single AI. Forget about servers for now. Implement all the logic.
2. Still one main player and a single AI, but manage them through servers. I.e., server now controls the phase timers, and AI has
to issue commands to the server, etc.
3. flush out server stuff, adding game rooms, authentications, etc.

Note, server and client will be bidirectionally. Server needs to manage phase timers and ping the client when phase changes.
So, the client needs to `forkIO` twice for a sending and receiving thread. The server can have one `fork` per client.

Callbacks can be used to implement both in-game logic and game rules. For example, omu's hero power can be implemented via a callback
to `tierUp`. Conversely, maybe `tierUp` can expand the `randomShopSize` via a callback, as opposed to this being built-in. For now, 
`randomShop` is directly dependent on `TavernTier`, but maybe that can change.

Taming `simulateCombat`. A few additions to make
- Allow each call of `go` add multiple snapshots to the combat history. Each `go` handles all that transpires from one player's turn, which involves
    - capture initial state
	- on minion attack (capture state)
	- minions trade (capture state, dead minions are snapped)
	- clear dead minions (capture state)
	- trigger deathrattles (capture state)

- `go` updates the next attack indices. This is a simple +=1 if no deaths/summons occured. On the other hand â€”
	- If summon(s), handle from left to right, one by one: if summonIndex <= atkIndex then atkIndex += 1
	- If death(s), handle from left to right, one by one: if deadIndex <= atkIndex then atkIndex -= 1
	- Handle summons before deaths. This way, handling deathrattles that summon works out perfectly (consider Harmless Bonehead)

Today's goal: 
- Get rid of cardId. I forgot why those were ever needed, but they are slowing progress.
- Write tests for Harmless Bonehead, and then implement!
